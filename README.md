# Bukusu-English Dictionary
This is an Android application for looking up English definitions of Bukusu words. It is intended to serve as a guide to language learners who know English but seek knowledge of the Bukusu language. A rudimentary grasp of the Bukusu language is assumed, though.

The current version of the application is largely based on the draft of the ['Bukusu-English Dictionary'](https://www.academia.edu/1901981/Lubukusu_English_dictionary) compiled and edited by Michael Marlo, Adrian Sifuna and Aggrey Wasike (2008).

Efforts are underway to expand upon this base and further contributions by Bukusu language experts and native speakers are encouraged.

## Basic Features
The application allows a user to search for a Bukusu word from the search box withing the action bar at the top of the screen. 

Suggestions corresponding to the current search term appear as a scrollable drop-down list with individually clickable/selectable words. 

It is also possible to lookup a specific word on the alphabetically ordered list of all available words on the 'LOOKUP' tab on the main application screen. 

Upon performing a successful search or lookup, the definition of the required word is displayed on the 'DEFINITION' tab. 
Searching for words not contained in the dictionary will result in a message communicating an unsuccessful search being displayed on the main screen.

## About
The Bukusu-English Dictionary app is the result of volunteer effort. As such, the developer is looking for collaborators and contributors to help make the dictionary better.
