    <string name="help_menu_pronunciation_guide_text">
"The dictionary retains all the tone marking of the original source but also includes the spelling of words as commonly spelled/used.

In the present transcription system, long vowels are marked as a sequence of two vowels, e.g.,[aa]. A syllable boundary between two vowels is marked by &#39;.&#39;. High-tone is marked with an acute accent. Low-tone is unmarked, &#39;b&#39; represents [b] after a nasal and [β] elsewhere, &#39;ch&#39; represents [č], &#39;sh&#39; represents [š], &#39;kh&#39; represents [x], &#39;ng&#39;&#39; (&#39;ng&#39; followed by an apostrophe) represents [ŋ], &#39;nj&#39; represents [ñǰ], and &#39;ng&#39; represents [ŋg].

In general, &#39;ny&#39; should represent the palatal nasal [ñ], although there may be cases where the same orthographic sequence represents the sequence of a coronal nasal followed by a palatal glide, i.e., [ny]."
